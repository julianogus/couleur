# CoolorIt

**CoolorIt** is a side project developed to extract color palettes from images.  
It was initially created for personal use, as I often design applications using color palettes inspired by pictures, videos, and music albums.  

CoolorIt is built with **React.js** and is designed to be simple, intuitive, and efficient.
